## Hi there, this is Visakh Vijayan. 

I come from the magical land of Kerala and am an aspiring software engineer. I divide my time between office work in the morning and consulting in the evening. This gives me a chance to stay in touch with both the industry and small business. 

Creating softwares is a passion. It takes days of efforts just to think about the design and schema of the software. Although the software development cycle is a pretty boring one, the end result is something I always wait for. I feel very proud when I get to see an actual project which I have been part of being used by a customer.
